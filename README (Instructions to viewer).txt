The final submission is the second submission.

The first submission contains movies and such that connect to the analysis made on different parts. The first submission also contains some section views and exploded views
that are not present in the final submission. This is due to that the final submission is a complete new assembly with a more desirable structure of subassemblies etc. 
The first submission contains a lot of work which led to the final representation in the second submission. I dont intend the first submission to represent the final product
but perhaps aid in understanding the process or the structure as a whole.
